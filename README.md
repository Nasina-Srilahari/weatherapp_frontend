# A Full-Stack Weather Application

An application to check the weather of a particular city at that moment.

## Front-End

Here you have to enter the city name to get the weather.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87568450/235324814-cb67789d-7c50-4d41-8c5d-86d3b0bdc073.png)

## How it Works?
Here in this application I used ReatJs Javascript Library for frontend and Python Django Framework for backend

Reactjs Axios is a promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript. It has the ability to make HTTP requests from the browser and handle the transformation of request and response data.

Using which http request is made to the weather API(openweathermap.cpm) to the backend server to get the weather data of entered city.
